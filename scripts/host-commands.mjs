// substitute $ARGUMENTS, so one body serves both hosts. Only the location and
// the file name differ:
//
//   pi (prompt template, via package.json "pi.prompts")  pi-prompts/mcp-vm-relay-<name>.md  ->  /mcp-vm-relay-<name>
//   Claude Code (plugin command, from the plugin root)   commands/<name>.md                 ->  /mcp-vm-relay:<name>
//
// `npm run build` writes these files; tests and scripts/verify-package.mjs
// compare the committed and the packed files against this module byte for byte.

// reasons, derived from the raw evidence by this relay's rules. It reads the
// package and writes nothing; verify the package first with
// verifyDeliveredPackage if its integrity matters. The trajectory viewer that
// presents it lives in pi-secretary's computer-use extension (docs/design.md,
// "Trajectory viewer moves out").
